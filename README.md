# Online Sound Board

This is a simple website that has buttons that play sound effects. I coded this for a school play that was performed remotely to give all the crew members access to the sound effects.

## Usage

To use it just click the buttons and then it plays a sound.

## Changing sounds

All of the sounds are pre-programmed. To change them find the `<audio>` element and change the `src` attribute. On the `By Page` page, you will need to change all occurrences.
